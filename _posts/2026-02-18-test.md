On Monday, Sheena and I spoke to Radio Orkney about the project. You can [listen here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002rh5s). Thanks to Stewart and Rob for having us on.
There's a shorter clip of us talking on Tuesday's *Around Orkney* which you can [listen to here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002rwhx).
