title: "Whisky Well"

Fields aren't the only features whose names don't appear on the Ordnance Survey map. This well near Roeberry was [first recorded in 1879](https://maps.nls.uk/view/74427959) but its name only surfaced when we received a set of field-names from Hoxa.

I'm not sure how long it's had that name or why, though there was another Whisky Well in Stirling, apparently named on "account of the virtues of its waters for mixing with whisky, without any perceptible deterioration of the latter."[^1]

'Minor names' - names of small things, rather than unimportant names - like this are a fascinating part of the linguistic landscape. If you have names for wells, stones and other things in and about fields, we'd love to hear about them.
